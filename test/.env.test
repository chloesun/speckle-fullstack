# This is a base file for configuring the speckle server. Steps:
# 2. Copy it to .env ( `cp .env-base .env`)
# 2. Configure the .env file with your settings.
# 3. Start the speckle server!
#
# NOTE: If these are set through a different process, eg docker, pm2, or command line
# they will not be overwritten.

# SERVER_NAME: The server name is important, as it will help users differentiate
# between multiple accounts.
SERVER_NAME="Please Change My Name Server"

# CANONICAL_URL: The url address (if you have any) where this server exists. For example,
# a canonical url can be "https://hestia.speckle.works".

# PUBLIC_STREAMS: Wether all streams created should be public (true) or private (false)
# by default.
PUBLIC_STREAMS=true

# PLUGIN_DIRS: Dirs to scan for speckle plugins (comma separated). For example, if you install
# some other modules in `./test` and `./wonderful`, you could use PLUGIN_DIRS="./test,./wonderful"

# PORT: The port you want the speckle server to run on. Make sure the port is accesible
# if you have any firewalls set up (ie, ufw).
PORT=3000

# IP: The ip to listen to
# Defaults to all IPs bound to this machine, and all IPv6 IPs if IPv6 is enabled.
# If you want to bind to IPv4 only, or a specific IPv6/v4 address, uncomment the line below and specifiy your preferred address.
# IP=127.0.0.1

# MAX_PROC: The maximum amount of service workers to start. If this is not specified,
# Speckle will fork out as many as the machine's processor cores. To specify it,
# just uncomment the line below.
MAX_PROC=1

# REQ_SIZE: The request size protects your server from being flooded with too much data.
REQ_SIZE=10mb

# This is used in the encryption of the api access tokens.
# Please change it to something random!
SESSION_SECRET="helloworld"

#
# DBs
#

# Mongodb URI: this is the uri string that the server will use to connect to your mongo instance.
# The default string below will work with an out-of-the-box local mongodb deployment.
# For more info, see: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/
MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/TestingDB"

# Redis URI: this is the uri string that the server will use to connect to your redis instance.

# Housekeeping

#
# Email sending
# This is future functionality that will be used for password resets, email
# confirmation, etc. when using the default auth strategy. It will also be used
# to send notifications (not in the near future though).
#

# SMTP server
# This section is used to send emails out. You can use the provider of your choice,
# as long as it exposes an SMTP server that you can use. Some of these providers are:
# sparkpost, mailgun, sendgrid.
SMTP_HOST="CHANGE_ME"
SMTP_PORT=587

# Authentication Strategies
