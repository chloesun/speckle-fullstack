<h1>Sample Speckle Frontend Plugin</h1>
<p>This is just  an example of  how you can register a speckle frontend plugin. Its manifest file looks something like this:</p>
<pre>
{
  "name": "Sample Plugin",
  "version":"",
  "desc": "This plugin tests plugins",
  "serveFrom": "/sample-plugin",
  "author": "DAS",
  "contact":"test@dimitrie.org",
  "homepage":"https://dimitrie.org"
}
</pre>
<p>
  This file (`speckle-plugin-manifest.json`) is picked up by the server which then serves the plugin statically from the location specified.
</p>
